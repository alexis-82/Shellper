# Shellper
A basic Python script, made for helping Linux newbies in the use of terminal

When you've used for a lot of time systems like Windows or MacOS, and then you decide to switch to a Linux distro, sometimes
it's very difficult to use the terminal.
So I decided to make a script which makes quicker some basic operations (mounting usb\drives, connecting to a wifi network)
and I'm going to add new features in the future, such as an automatic installer of the script from the net and other things.

6 DEC 2016:
    Finally, the automatic installer has been added!
    To directly execute it, just paste this command in your terminal, without quotes: 
    "  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davix3f/Shellper/master/auto_install.py -O- | python "
